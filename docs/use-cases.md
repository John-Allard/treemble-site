title: Treemble Use Cases
---

Treemble is a lightweight, canvas-based tool for extracting, editing, and exporting tree topologies in Newick (and SVG) form.  While it’s built with phylogenetic researchers in mind, its flexible canvas and Newick import/export make it valuable for **anyone** working with hierarchical or tree-structured data.

## 1. Biology & Phylogenetics

- **Reanalyze published trees**  
  Import a PNG/PDF from a paper, extract the Newick, and run your own downstream analyses (e.g., dating, model tests).

- **Combine or compare multiple topologies**  
  Merge clades from different studies into a single “supertree,” or rapidly sketch alternative hypotheses for topology testing.

- **Whiteboard→Analysis workflow**  
  Snap a photo of a rough draft on a whiteboard or paper, extract its Newick, then feed it directly into R, Python, or open it in MEGA, FigTree,or other phylogenetics software.

- **Interactive hypothesis generation**  
  Quickly sketch variations on a backbone tree to explore how different topologies affect downstream statistics.

- **Teaching phylogenetics / clustering**  
  Let students sketch trees by hand or drag-and-drop tip names, then immediately export a Newick string to see how their trees parse in R or Python, or open it in a tree editor like MEGA.

- **Dichotomous taxonomic keys**  
  Classic identification keys successively split specimens into two mutually exclusive groups at each step.

## 2. Dendrograms & Hierarchical Clustering

- **Data science & machine learning**  
  Visualize and refine hierarchical clustering outputs (e.g. customer segments, gene expression clusters) by editing cluster shapes, pruning branches, or relabeling tips.

- **Decision-tree model diagrams**  
  Most machine-learning decision trees split on a yes/no criterion at every node, producing a binary tree.

## 3. Other Fields

Treemble may be useful in many fields where Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships.

- **Evolutionary trees in other settings**
  Fields like linguistics also use evolutionary trees to represent ancestral splitting events through time.

- **Medical differential diagnosis trees**  
  Construct or refine yes/no diagnostic trees that help clinicians narrow possible conditions step-by-step.

- **Troubleshooting flowcharts (yes/no)**  
  Technical support or diagnostic guides that follow binary questions map cleanly onto bifurcating trees.

- **Choose-your-own-adventure narratives**  
  Story paths designed with two options at each decision point can be extracted and re-edited as binary trees.

- **Single-elimination tournament brackets**  
  Sports or e-sports brackets progress via head-to-head matches.

---

## 4. Figures, Posters & Publications

- **Rapid figure prototyping**  
  Sketch a draft tree, export SVG, drop into Illustrator or Inkscape, and add styling—all in minutes instead of hours.

- **High-quality outputs**  
  Generate publication-ready vector images without manually aligning shapes in a graphics program.

### Got another idea?

Treemble’s blank canvas, Newick import/export, and SVG vector output mean **any** tree-structured diagram can be created, cleaned up, and shared—across biology, data science, humanities, and beyond. If you’ve found a novel way to use it, let us know on GitHub Discussions!
